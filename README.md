# Biomechanical-Analysis-of-Hammer-Throw-Stereo-Data
This repository analyzes hammer throw biomechanics from C3D stereo motion capture data. It creates cached files, applies cuts based on hammer speed, calculates variables like tangential and angular velocity, detects key events (angles, foot lift, lowest point), and plots results.
